We'll be analyzing how Americans spend their time.

The [American Time Use Survey](https://www.bls.gov/tus/overview.htm#1)
 interviewed $8,782$ people in 2020 and inquired about how these individuals allocate their time to different tasks on a weekday. Some variables collected include:
 
 <ul>
  <li>TRTFRIEND: Total nonwork-related time respondent spent with friends (in minutes) [Min:0, Max: 1440] </li>
  <li>TRTSPONLY: Total nonwork-related time respondent spent with spouse only (in minutes) </li>
  <li>TRTCCC: Total nonwork-related time respondent spent with customers, clients, and coworkers (in minutes)</li>
  <li>TRTALONE: Total nonwork-related time respondent spent alone (in minutes) </li>
  <li>TRTFAMILY: Total nonwork-related time respondent spent with family members 
 </li>
 <li>TRCHILDNUM: Number of household Children < 18 </li>
 <li> TRERNWA: Weekly earnings at main job [For non-hourly wage earners]</li>
 <li> TRERNHLY: Hourly earnings at main job [For hourly wage earners]</li>
 <li> TUCC2: Time first child < 13 woke up [For those with children -- in number of minutes past midnight]</li>
 <li> TUCC4: Time last household child < 13 went to bed [For those with children] -- in number of minutes past midnight</li>
</ul>

The population of interest is Americans and how they spend their time on a typical weekday. So there are $10$ distributions of interest, and we would like to do inference for the mean of each of these distributions.

Although contrived, from now on we will assume that the entire ATUS survey results **are the entire** population -- i.e we are assuming that every American is included in the ATUS survey results. 

And we will use a random subsampling of the ATUS survey results to do inference about the population of all Americans (assuming that all Americans have been surveyed by ATUS).

With this strategy, here is the POPULATION dataset.

## Question 1: Use the POPULATION dataset to compute the mean total time spent alone (in minutes) on a week day for Americans in 2020
Answer is $362.0627$ minutes

Using an approach like that you used in question 1, here are our population means for the other variables.

 <ul>
  <li>TRTFRIEND: 22.228 minutes 
  <li>TRTSPONLY: 114.421 minutes</li>
  <li>TRTCCC: 3.964 minutes</li>
  <li>TRTFAMILY: 295.0263 minutes
 </li>
 <li>TRCHILDNUM: .6522 children </li>
 <li> TRERNWA: 21.3226\$</li>
 <li> TRERNHLY: 1176.6790\$</li>
 <li> TUCC2: 451.7254 minutes</li>
 <li> TUCC4: 1212.3868 minutes</li>
</ul>


## Question 2: What is the population standard deviation for time spent alone?

Now lets imagine we didn't have access to the population. We only have access to a sample of 200 independent and identically distribution observations for each variable.

Here is the SAMPLE data

## Question 3: Using the CLT, and the population variance you computed in question 2, find a $90\%$ confidence interval for the population mean time spent along by using the sample data.
