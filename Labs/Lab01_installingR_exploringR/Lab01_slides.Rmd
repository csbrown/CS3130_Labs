## R and R Markdown

- Tools for reproducible data analysis and reporting
- reproducible, adj. - Capable of being reproduced at a different time or place and by different people.
- R: data analysis, Rmarkdown: data reporting
  - <img src="static/latency.png" style="height:30vh;">
- Rmarkdown $\approx$ R + [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

## Reproducible Data Analysis

- The point of Statistics is providing evidence
- What if all of your evidence involves a heaping load of "take my word on it"?
- Prevent this by providing the tools to reproduce your evidence along with your evidence!

## Slide with R Output

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Slide with Plot

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```
